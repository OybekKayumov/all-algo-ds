Data structures: Stack Operations

push: Inserts item to the top of the stack. Time complexity is O(1).

pop: Removes items from the top of stack. Time complexity is O(1).

top: Returns top element of the stack. Time complexity is O(1).

empty: Returns “true”, if stack is empty. Time complexity is O(1).

size: Returns size of stack. Time complexity is O(1).
